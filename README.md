If you do anything with data today, you're likely using something created by Wes McKinney. Wes is the creator of some of the most popular data engineering tools, including [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow), and [Ibis](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis). He’s also a core contributor to Apache Parquet.

​Wes McKinney’s work is all about making data systems composable. Composability requires everyone to follow the same open standards. He believes that decomposing a data system into modular and reusable components makes it much easier for companies to plug and play these components to build complex data systems.

In this talk, he will share what composable data systems mean annd what he thinks data systems will look like in the next 10 years.
